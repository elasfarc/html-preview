            Cairokee is an Egyptian rock band that was officially launched in 2003 but came to prominence with its
            revolutionary
            music following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 due to its politically-inspired lyrics and protest songs
            released
            following the uprising. Their title song "Ya El Midan", featuring Egyptian singer Aida el Ayoubi who had
            previously
            retired in the 1990s, ranked number one on Facebook worldwide for downloads and number eight on YouTube with
            more than
            half a million views on the video channel in just two days following its internet release.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                The band consists of Amir Eid (lead vocalist), Sherif Hawary (lead guitarist), Tamer Hashem (drummer),
                Sherif Mostafa
                (keyboardist), and Adam el-Alfy (bass guitarist). The initial band members were friends ever since their
                school days,
                and Tamer was already a drummer back then. In 2003, Eid and Hawary had started an English band initially
                called Black
                Star.They started playing covers of English songs, with only one Egyptian Masry song called "Ghariba"
                that was
                highly admired by their audiences. They later decided to continue making Egyptian songs because they
                felt it was
                shameful to keep playing English music as it wasn't their mother tongue. They were mainly influenced by
                the works of
                Pink Floyd and The Beatles and regard Pink Floyd's music as an inspiration for their own musical career.
