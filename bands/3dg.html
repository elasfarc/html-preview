                Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in Norwood, Ontario in 1992 originally as Groundswell.
                Groundswell
                played in various local Norwood backyard parties and area establishments before disbanding in 1995 and
                regrouping in
                1997 under its current name.

                Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier,
                drummer
                and backing
                vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead
                guitarist, making
                them a quartet. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by My Darkest Days' vocalist Matt Walst,
                the
                younger
                brother of Brad Walst.
