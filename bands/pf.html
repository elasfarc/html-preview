            Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first
            British
            psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation,
            philosophical lyrics
            and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the
            greatest
            progressive rock band of all time.
        </p>
        <p>By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling
            music artists
            of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame,[1] and these
            albums and
            Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US
            Billboard 200,
            and five topped the UK Albums Chart. Pink Floyd's hit singles include "See Emily Play" (1967), "Money"
            (1973), "Another
            Brick in the Wall, Part 2" (1979), "Not Now John" (1983), "On the Turning Away" (1987) and "High Hopes"
            (1994). They
            were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008,
            Pink Floyd
            were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters
                (bassguitar,
                vocals) and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting
                singles and the
                successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour
                joined in
                January
                1968; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist
                and
                thematic
                leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon

                Wish You
                Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd The
                Wall (1982),
